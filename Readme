Tinder Bot that swipes automticlly to the right for busy and geeks that don't get enough time to swipe themselves.

This is built by using:
1)Python
2)Selenium
3)Web Driver: Chrome Driver from Google Chrome

What to do before:-
1) Have the latest update of Google Chrome Browser
2) Install selenium for python. Type the following command if you don't have it installed already
   "pip install selenium"
3) Install the latest chrome driver (I would prefer beta over stable version though). Download from this
   link [http://chromedriver.chromium.org]
4) There is a separate file called "facebook_credentials". Open the file, and enter your facebook user id and password and then save it.


How to run the bot:-
1) Open the "tinderbot" in the command prompt and run it.
2) Incase, anyone forgot how to run python files in command prompt, type this after going to the respective directory of this files
   "python -i tinderbot.py"
   
I have also added a video demo of how the tinderbot actually works.
